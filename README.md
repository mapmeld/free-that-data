FreeThatData.com is a readme of options for someone who has data (especially
geo data) and wants to free it to the public, at little or no cost.

The options, from "one star" to "five stars" are:

1. Digitize the Data
2. Publish Open Data
3. Establish a Data Service
4. Contribute to OpenStreetMap
5. Engage with Developers and Mappers

We're including examples of governments which have done each step so you
know you're not alone!
