            <h5>Digitize the Data</h5>
            <p>When you want to share your data with others, the last thing that you want to do is make copies and mail a physical envelope. But most information is still printed, or even handwritten, and passed around on paper!</p>
            <p>If you have a dataset which would be useful to open up, and share with citizens and developers, the first most important thing that you can do is to find the original file or make a digital copy.</p>
            <p>Is it good to scan in some documents? Yes and no. If there is a digital copy, try to find the original file so it will have the top quality and be easily readable by people and computer programs.</p>

            <p>Want to research why to open up data? Read
              <a href="https://www.codeforamerica.org/governments/principles/open-data/">Code for America's Open Data Playbook</a>

              <a href="http://opendata.guide/">Open Data Guide</a>.
            </p>
            <p>Upload files to your website, CKAN, or GitHub. For your first open data project, it isn't so important where you put the files, as long as they are public and findable.</p>
            <p>As soon as you have some data online, you won't be getting as many requests for copies. But people might ask about new datasets!</p>
            <p>Make a plan to keep these files updated over time. If you are uploading the 2015 budget, make a plan for someone to upload the 2016 budget next year.</p>

            <h5>Establish a Data Service</h5>
            <p>Once you publish a few different files, and update that data, you might want to consider making a data service or an Application Programming Interface (API).</p>
            <p>If your website has reliable uptime and updates, a programmer might want their app to get different types of information directly from you, instead of just downloading the data and saving a copy in their app.</p>
            <p>Use a system like GitHub, Socrata, or a homemade solution to publish your data continuously. Also use a service like Apigee to document how developers can request information from your system.</p>

            <h5>Contribute to OpenStreetMap</h5>
            <p>Find roads, buildings, parks, or other surface-level, public interest data which could appear on OpenStreetMap. Find the latest version of the data and convert it to an open format (KML, GeoJSON).</p>
            <p>Download JOSM and install its "opendata" plugin. Import the dataset and compare it to OpenStreetMap. Even if your data is up-to-date, try to avoid overwriting or replacing existing map data.</p>
            <p>Create a separate account to upload the new, curated data. Explain the background for your imported data.</p>

            <h5>Engage with Developers and Mappers</h5>
            <p>Plan to release your data not just on the web, but at an in-person event with the technical community. Open your doors and answer questions from programmers, startups, businesspeople, and others in government.</p>
            <p>It's tricky to plan the right event, find the right venue, and invite everyone. But research how to set up a 'hackathon' or a 'mapping party' to get started. Work with developers and make sure you have good WiFi and internet access at the event headquarters.</p>
